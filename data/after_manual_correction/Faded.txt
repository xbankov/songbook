[Am]You were the shadow to my [F]light
Did you feel us[C]
Another [G]star
You fade away[Am]
Afraid our aim is out of sig[F]ht
Wanna see us[C]
Al[G]ight
{end_of_verse}

Where are you [Am]now[F]
Where are you [C]now[G]
Where are you [Am]now
Was it all in my [F]fantasy
Where are you [C]now
Were you only i[G]maginary

{start_of_chorus}
Where are you [Am]now
Atl[F]antis
Under the [C]sea
Under the [G]sea
Where are you [Am]now
Another [F]dream
The mo[C]nsters running wild inside of me[G]
I'm faded[Am][F]
I'm faded[C]
So lo[G]st, I'm faded[Am][F]
I'm faded[C]
 So lo[G]st, I'm faded
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
[Am]These shallow waters, never [F]met
What I needed[C]
I'm letting g[G]o
A deeper dive[Am]
Eternal silence of the [F]sea
I'm breathing[C]
Al[G]ive
{end_of_verse}

Where are you [Am]now[F]
Where are you [C]now[G]
Under the [Am]bright

You set my [F]heart on fire
Where are you n[C]ow
Where are you [G]now

{start_of_chorus}
Where are you[Am] now
Atl[F]antis
Under the [C]sea
Under the [G]sea
Where are you n[Am]ow
Another [F]dream
The [C]monsters running wild inside of m[G]e
I'm faded[Am][F]
I'm faded[C]
So lo[G]st, I'm faded[Am][F]
I'm faded[C]
 So lo[G]st, I'm fa[Am]ded

{title: A horse with no name}

[Intro]

[Em]    [Em]   [D6/9]  [D6/9]  x2

[Verse 1]

On the [Em]first part of the [D6/9]journey
I was [Em]looking at all the [D6/9]life
There were [Em]plants and birds and [D6/9]rocks and things
There were [Em]sand and hills and [D6/9]rings
The [Em]first thing I met was a [D6/9]fly with a buzz
And the [Em]sky with no cl[D6/9]ouds
The [Em]heat was hot and the g[D6/9]round was dry
But the [Em]air was full of so[D6/9]und

[Chorus]

I've [Em9]been through the desert on a[Dmaj9] horse with no name
It felt [Em9]good to be out of the[Dmaj9] rain
In the d[Em9]esert you can re[Dmaj9]member your name
'Cause there a[Em9]in't no one for to[Dmaj9] give you no pain
[Em9]La, la, la [Dmaj9]lala la la la, la, la
[Em9]La, la, la [Dmaj9]lala la la la, la, la

[Verse 2]

After [Em]two days in the [D6/9]desert sun
My s[Em]kin began to turn [D6/9]red
After t[Em]hree days in the [D6/9]desert fun
I was [Em]looking at a river [D6/9]bed
And the [Em]story it told of a [D6/9]river that flowed
Made me [Em]sad to think it was [D6/9]dead

[Chorus]

You see I've [Em9]been through the desert on a[Dmaj9] horse with no name
It felt g[Em9]ood to be out of the[Dmaj9] rain
In the [Em9]desert you can [Dmaj9]remember your name
'Cause [Em9]there ain't no one for to[Dmaj9] give you no pain
La, [Em9]la, la lal[Dmaj9]a la la la, la, la
La, l[Em9]a, la lala [Dmaj9]la la la, la, la

[Verse 3]

After [Em]nine days I let the [D6/9]horse run free
'Cause the [Em]desert had turned to [D6/9]sea
There were [Em]plants and birds and [D6/9]rocks and things
There were [Em]sand and hills and [D6/9]rings
The [Em]ocean is a desert with its [D6/9]life underground
And a [Em]perfect disguise [D6/9]above
Under the [Em]cities lies a [D6/9]heart made of ground
But the [Em]humans will give no [D6/9]love

[Chorus]

You see, I've [Em9]been through the desert on a[Dmaj9] horse with no name
It felt [Em9]good to be out of the[Dmaj9] rain
In the [Em9]desert you can r[Dmaj9]emember your name
'Cause [Em9]there ain't no one for to[Dmaj9] give you no pain
[Em9]La, la, la [Dmaj9]lala la la la, la, la
[Em9]La, la, la [Dmaj9]lala la la la, la, la
[Em9]La, la, la [Dmaj9]lala la la la, la, la
[Em9]La, la, la [Dmaj9]lala la la la, la, la
[Em9]La, la, la [Dmaj9]lala la la la, la, la
[Em9]La, la, la [Dmaj9]lala la la la, la, la
[Em9]La, la, la [Dmaj9]lala la la la, la, la
[Em9]La, la, la [Dmaj9]lala la la la, la, la
